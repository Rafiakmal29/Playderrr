//
// The contract between Playder and a source module (Apple Music first). A module finds the track
// Playder wants on its service and hands back a stream the player opens; Playder does all the
// playing, so the equalizer, Audio FX, Crossmix and the visuals work on any source.
//
// Modules are built into Playder today. The contract is kept free of Android, Media3 and HTTP
// libraries so that a module can also ship as its own APK, found and loaded at runtime (see
// ModuleRegistry in the app). Change any shape here and bump MODULE_API_VERSION: a module built
// against another version is refused rather than crashing.
